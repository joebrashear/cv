            Hello! I'm William Brashear, but I go by my middle name, Joe. I am a
            senior CS major at UCF. My prior work experience involves working as
            a Software Integration Intern at Qualcomm San Diego for four months
            over summer 2021 and a Software Engineer Intern at Lockheed Martin
            MFC Orlando for one year and one month. Outside of school, I served
            as the President and co-founder of SASE for about two years, going
            on 3. I have a huge passion for working on the cutting edge of
            technology, expanding my technical expertise, and utilizing my
            software knowledge to solve the world's most challenging problems.
            Given my advanced skills in software development and a year and a
            half of experience in the Software Industry, I believe I am a
            perfect fit for any full-time Software Engineering role after June
            2022, when I graduate.
